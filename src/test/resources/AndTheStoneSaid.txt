I was alone and it was night
I had nobody else to turn to
But the voices talking to me from afar
And with endearing words so silent
They told me the secret about who you really are
A million images and words, long since forgotten
Of events that no one ever saw
I hear a whimper as I kneel
Realizing that it's your pain that I feel
"In this house of worship I'm a stone"

And as I wandered through the night
I felt a presence of the past, the future
And the present now
The voices placed me in the minds
Of two young lovers
The husband in the war who's never coming home
The young girl realizing she's in fact a boy
